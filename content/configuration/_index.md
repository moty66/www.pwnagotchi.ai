Once you've [written the image file onto the SD card](/installation/#flashing-an-image), there're a few steps you'll have to follow in order to configure your new Pwnagotchi properly.

## Initial Configuration

For the initial configuration, the easiest way is creating a new `config.yml` file of the `boot` partition of the SD card.
This partition should be easily accessible from your computer regardless of your operating system as it is a simple FAT32. 

In this process you might define your unit's name, which network to whitelist and the type of display you use. The following
is the example configuration for a unit with a Waveshare V2 display, for more detailed configuration instructions refer to the 
sections below.

```yaml
main:
  name: 'pwnagotchi'
  whitelist:
    - 'YourHomeNetworkMaybe'
  plugins:
    grid:
      enabled: true
      report: true
      exclude:
        - 'YourHomeNetworkMaybe'

ui:
    display:
      type: 'waveshare_2'
      color: 'black'
```

The software will install this file to `/etc/pwnagotchi/config.yml` (and it will **remove** it from the SD card) during boot. 

After the first boot, you can open the `/etc/pwnagotchi/config.yml` file (either via SSH or by directly editing the SD 
card's contents from a computer with a card reader) to override the [default configuration](https://github.com/evilsocket/pwnagotchi/blob/master/pwnagotchi/defaults.yml) with 
your custom values.

## Restoring a Backup

If you want to [restore a backup](/usage/#backup-your-pwnagotchi) instead, you can copy the contents of the `/etc/pwnagotchi` backupped 
folder in the FAT32 boot partition as `/boot/pwnagotchi`. This way the whole folder containing the configuration and the RSA keypair 
will be moved to `/etc/pwnagotchi` during boot. Restoring this folder this way will allow the unit to boot without the need to generate 
a new RSA keypair, operation that takes time and would be completely pointless if a backup needs to be restored anyway.

Given that the FAT32 boot partition is limited in size, other folders and files that are part of the backup will need to be copied manually either to the SD card,
if it's possible to mount it on a host computer, or via SSH with cable or bluetooth connectivity as explained in the following sections.

## Choose your unit's language

Pwnagotchi displays its UI in English by default, but it can speak several other languages! If you're fine with English, you don't need to do anything special here.

But if you **do** want to change what language Pwnagotchi displays its status in, you can change `main.lang` to one of the supported languages:

- **English** *(default)*
- German
- Italian
- French
- Russian
- Dutch
- Greek
- Swedish
- Macedonian
- Irish
- Japanese (can't be displayed with the current font)
- Polish
- Portugese
- Portugese (Brazilian)

## Set your PwnGrid preferences

By default, the `grid` [plugin](/plugins/) is **only partially** enabled. This means that whenever the unit will detect internet connectivity while in [MANUAL mode](/usage/#auto-ai-and-manu-modes), it will signal its existence to the PwnGrid server by sending ONLY the following enrollment data:

- The cryptographic identity of the unit, generated at first boot and used for authentication.
- The output of the `uname -a` command on the unit used to determine the type of hardware.

If you would like your unit to participate in PwnGrid's community rankings and scoreboards (PwnGrid is like PokÃ©mon Go, but for WiFi!), as well as be a datapoint in regional (country-level) statistics, you can **fully opt-in** to PwnGrid by enabling your unit to send the PwnGrid API some basic information about the networks it has pwned. **None of your unit's captured cryptographic material is sent to the PwnGrid server;** ONLY the minimum information to enroll the unit in the PwnGrid database (see above) and calculate how many networks it has "conquered" so far, namely:

- The list of networks that the unit collected handshakes of (consisting of their `BSSID` and `ESSID`).

In order to **fully opt-in** to PwnGrid, you must make the following change in your `/etc/pwnagotchi/config.yml` file:

```yaml
main:
    plugins:
      grid:
        enabled: true
        report: true # full-opt in
```

Even if you have decided to **fully opted-in** to PwnGrid, you can still disable reporting for specific networksâ€”for instance, if you don't want your home network to be in the system:

```yaml
main:
    plugins:
      grid:
        enabled: true
        report: true
        exclude:
          - MyHomeNetwork     # both ESSIDs and BSSIDs are supported
          - de:ad:be:ef:de:ad # both ESSIDs and BSSIDs are supported
```

{{% notice warning %}}
<p><b>PLEASE NOTE:</b>As we use <a href="https://yaml.org/">YAML</a> for the configuration, you should know some YAML rules. Especially when it comes to quotation, some things <b>can go wrong!</b> E.g. if your ESSIDs starts with <b>0x</b>
or <b>@</b> or contains some other special characters, you should use <b>single quotes</b>, which allows you to
use all kinds of characters in your string (you only need to escape the single quote itself).</p>
{{% /notice %}}

If instead you prefer to completely opt-out by also disabling signaling:

```yaml
main:
    plugins:
      grid:
        enabled: false # full opt-out
        report: false
```

## Select your display

{{% notice tip %}}
<p>If you want to use the web UI (instead of an e-ink display attached to your unit's RPi0W) to see your Pwnagotchi's face, check out the <a href="/usage/#user-interface">User Interface</a> doc for more details on using the web UI.</p>
{{% /notice %}}

**Set the type of display you want to use via `ui.display.type`.**
If your display does not work after changing this setting, you might need to completely remove power from the Raspberry Pi and make a clean boot.

Currently supported:

* `waveshare_2` for the V2 version of [Waveshare's ePaper HAT](https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/2.13inch_e-Paper_HAT), [this is the recommended and officially supported display](/installation/#required-hardware).
* `waveshare_1` for the V1 legacy version of [Waveshare's ePaper HAT](https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/2.13inch_e-Paper_HAT)
* `waveshare27inch` for [2.7inch e-Paper HAT](https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/2.7inch_e-Paper_HAT)
* `waveshare154inch` for [1.54inch e-Paper Module (B)](https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/1.54inch_e-Paper_Module_\(B\))
* `inky` for [Pimoroni's Inky pHAT](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/inky-phat).
* `papirus` for [PaPiRus Zero](https://thepihut.com/products/papirus-zero-epaper-eink-screen-phat-for-pi-zero).
* `oledhat` for [Waveshare's OLED Hat](https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/1.3inch_OLED_HAT).
* `dfrobot` for [DFRobot's eInk Hat](https://www.dfrobot.com/product-1867.html)

**You can configure the refresh interval of the display via `ui.fps`.** We recommend using a slow refresh rate to avoid shortening the lifetime of your e-ink display. The default value is `0`, which will *only* refresh when changes are made to the screen.

## First Boot

Your `config.yml` file in the `boot` partition of the SD card should now look something like the following (with the
right differences if you're using different hardware):

```yaml
main:
  name: 'pwnagotchi'
  whitelist:
    - 'YourHomeNetworkMaybe'
  plugins:
    grid:
      enabled: true
      report: true
      exclude:
        - 'YourHomeNetworkMaybe'

ui:
  display:
    type: 'inky'
    color: 'black'
```

**Congratulations! Your SD card is now ready for the first boot!** ðŸ‘¾ ðŸŽ‰

## Connect to your Pwnagotchi

You can connect to your Pwnagotchi via SSH.

{{% notice warning %}}
<p><b>PLEASE NOTE:</b> If you cannot connect to your Pwnagotchi <b>no matter what you try</b>, ensure that the micro-USB you are using <b>allows data transfer</b> and doesn't ONLY provide charge. Cheaper quality micro-USB cords often do not support data transfer and will NOT allow you to actually connect to your Pwnagotchi. :'( <b>Use a quality cord!</b></p>
{{% /notice %}}

![ui](https://i.imgur.com/uLdQYqF.png)

1. Start by connecting the micro-USB cable to the **data port** of your Pwnagotchi's RPi0W, then connect the other end of that cable to your computer.
2. **If your Pwnagotchi has already been booted up at least once before:** after a few seconds, you will see a new Ethernet interface on your host computer.
     - **If you have never booted your Pwnagotchi before:** it will take a few minutes to boot up &/or become visible or responsive. **DO NOT INTERRUPT YOUR PWNAGOTCHI DURING THIS PROCESS.** That extra time it takes to boot the first time you turn your Pwnagotchi on? It's because it is generating its RSA keys; if you interrupt this process, the generated keys may be corrupted!
3. You'll need to configure it with a static IP address:
     - IP: `10.0.0.1`
     - Netmask: `255.255.255.0`
     - Gateway: `10.0.0.1`
     - DNS (if required): `8.8.8.8` *(or whatever)*
4. If everything's been configured properly, you will now be able to `ping` either `10.0.0.2` or `pwnagotchi.local`
     * If you have already [configured the name](/configuration/#name-your-new-pwnagotchi) of your Pwnagotchi, `pwnagotchi.local` won't work. Instead, try *your unit's hostname* + `.local`.
5. **Congratulations!** You should now be able to connect to your unit using SSH:

```bash
ssh pi@10.0.0.2 # default password: raspberry
```

## Connecting to Pi0w with MicroUSB cable on Linux Host

* Works for Release RC5 *

{{% notice warning %}}
<p><b>DEV NOTE:</b> These are directions for the recommended hardware, a Pi0w - and connecting to it from a Linux based host via a Micro-USB through the data port. This was written while connecting to a Pi0w with a Data Capable MicroUSB to a Macbook Pro late 2012 running Ubuntu 19.04. We can not guarantee these specific directions work on any other OS. Hopefully further write ups will be provided at a later date.</p>

### Pre-Face

* If you have any wired interfaces on your host PC, you will need to remove them from Network Manager so we can be sure you have everything set correctly, on the correct interface.
* If you are using Wi-Fi on your host computer, you need to be certain that your routers IP address scheme is not in the `10.0.0.1/24` range. If it is, you should turn Wi-Fi off initially to best troubleshoot your connectivity issues, then change the interface IP scheme on your Pi once you can `ssh` to it.
* These settings are only verified to work on, **1.** *a Pi0w*, with a **2.** *MicroUSB data capable cable,* **3.** the newest released image found on [our Github](https://github.com/evilsocket/pwnagotchi/releases/) *which at the time of writing is RC5,* and **4.** a *completely* vanilla image(*plug-in and whitelist configuration is fine, but if you have previously adjusted the UI: from `10.0.0.2` to `0.0.0.0`, you need to revert those changes by deleting anything related to `UI:` in your `config.yml`.*)
![ui](https://i.imgur.com/uLdQYqF.png)
#### Steps to complete on your host (the pc that you are connecting the Pi to)
1. First, type `ifconfig` to check and take note of the names of your current interfaces, and what is now recognized as an adapter on your system. **Take note of the Mac Addresses that you see in this output.**
2. Starting with a clean slate in your Network Manager (remove all wired interface profiles that you have on your Network Manager,) plug your unpowered Pi0w into your computer through the data port seen in the picture shown above .
3. Wait until your Pi boots into Manu mode. Once you see the breakdown that Pwnagotchi does when in MANU mode, type `ifconfig` again on your host machine and look for a new interface that was not there during **Step 1.**
***Take EXTRA note of the new interfaces mac address** I will be referencing this mac address on multiple occasions as **Step 3**.
    - **If you have never booted your Pwnagotchi before:** it will take a few minutes to boot up &/or become visible or responsive. **DO NOT INTERRUPT YOUR PWNAGOTCHI DURING THIS PROCESS.** That extra time it takes to boot the first time you turn your Pwnagotchi on? It's because it is generating its RSA keys; if you interrupt this process, the generated keys may be corrupted!*
4. On Network Manager on your PC/Host, (if there are no interfaces automatically added, you can attempt to add a new interface by selecting the mac address noted in **Step 3** for the interface profile) select Settings > IPv4 and then change from `automatic` to `manual`, then for your address, you'll need to configure it with a static IP address and then press apply in the top right:
     - IP: `10.0.0.1`
     - Netmask: `255.255.255.0`
5. Back in your terminal, type `ifconfig` and look for the interface that you found in **Step 3** and that you edited the settings for in **Step 4**. If you see the following on the second line of the interface that matches the mac address from **Step 3**, you should now be able to enter `ping 10.0.0.2` and receive a response from your pi.

```bash
inet 10.0.0.1  netmask 255.255.255.0  broadcast 10.0.0.255
```
6. **Congratulations!** You should now be able to connect to your unit using SSH:

```bash
ssh pi@10.0.0.2
```

#### About your SSH connection

The default password is `raspberry`; you should change it as soon as you log in for the first time by issuing the `passwd` command and selecting a new and more complex passphrase.

If you want to login directly without entering a password (recommended and necessary for certain packaged scripts to work, like `backup.sh` for instance!), copy your SSH public key to the unit's authorized keys:

```bash
ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub pi@10.0.0.2
```

## Host connection sharing

Want to be able to update your Pwnagotchi and access things from the internet on it? *Sure you do!*

1. Connect to the Pwnagotchi unit via `usb0` (A.K.A., using the data port).
2. Run the appropriate connection sharing script to bring the interface up on your end and share internet connectivity from another interface:

OS | Script Location | Link
---|-----------------|---------
Linux | `scripts/linux_connection_share.sh` | [link](https://github.com/evilsocket/pwnagotchi/blob/master/scripts/linux_connection_share.sh)
Mac OS X | `scripts/macos_connection_share.sh` | [link](https://github.com/evilsocket/pwnagotchi/blob/master/scripts/macos_connection_share.sh)
Windows | `scripts/win_connection_share.ps1` | [link](https://github.com/evilsocket/pwnagotchi/blob/master/scripts/win_connection_share.ps1)

### Bluetooth

If you want to upload your handshakes while walking, want to use your smartphone as a display or simply shutdown your pwnagotchi gracefully, you can use the `bt-tether`-plugin.

{{% notice warning %}}
<p><b>PLEASE NOTE:</b>Please note this is reported (on Slack) to work fine with Android, but not on iOS.</p>
{{% /notice %}}

{{% notice info %}}
<p>Make sure to explicitly enable Bluetooth Tethering on your Android Phone (usually in Settings -> Hotspot or similar). Otherwise your Pwnagotchi will pair with your phone but you won't be able to connect to it.</p>
{{% /notice %}}

Now in pwnagotchi's `config.yml` add the following:

```yaml
main:
    plugins:
      bt-tether:
        enabled: true
        mac: 'FF:FF:FF:FF:FF'  # you need to put your phones bt-mac here (the same as above, or goto your phones settings > status)
        ip: 'xx.xx.xx.44'    # this is the static ip of your pwnagotchi
                             # adjust this to your phones pan-network (run "ifconfig bt-pan" on your phone)
                             # if you feel lucky, try: 192.168.44.44 (Android) or 172.20.10.44 (iOS)
                             # 44 is just an example, you can choose between 2-254 (if netmask is 24)
        netmask: 24
        interval: 1
        share_internet: true   # this will change the routing and nameserver on your pi
```

Your pwnagotchi will indicate the status via a little `BT` symbol at the top of the screen.
The status codes are:

- **C** Connected: This means the connection to the device has been established.
- **NF** Not found: This means the connection to the device could not be established (probably because it could not be found).
- **PE** Pairing Error: This error occures on a pairing problem.
- **BE** Bnep Error: This error occures, when the `bnep0` interface could not be found.
- **AE** Address Error: The ip could not be assigned to the `bnep0` interface.

If you want to fix these problems, the first step should be to start pwnagotchi with `--debug` and
check the log file (`/var/log/pwnagotchi.log`) for related debug messages.

#### Known problems

Some users had problems with the **auto pairing** feature of the plugin (in old versions). If your pwnagotchi should not make an effort to connect to your bluetooth device after a few minutes, there is a chance that this can be fixed by doing the pairing manually. To do this, put your phone in *discoverable mode*. On your pwnagotchi, run `sudo bluetoothctl` and once in the bluetooth-shell, type `scan on`. That will scan the environment for nearby bluetooth devices.
Pick the mac of your phone and type `pair <mac>` and `trust <mac>`. In short time (maybe not immediately)
you will be prompted on the phone to allow connection from your pwnagotchi hostname.

**All done configuring your new Pwnagotchi?** Time to learn how to take care of your new friend over in [**Usage**](/usage/)!

If your network connection keeps flapping on your device connecting to your Pwnagotchi:
* Check if `usb0` (or equivalent) device is being controlled by NetworkManager.
* You can check this via `nmcli dev status`.
* If you are having trouble connecting to your Pi via USB, be sure you are using a microUSB cord that is capable of data transfer
